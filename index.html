          <h3>Get to Know Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi Wassup! My name is Kyanu Omar Eagan, but by default just call me
            Omar. I was born in Jakarta and was fortunate to be raised in one of
            the most thrilling and packed city out of all cities, South
            Tangerang. Growing up, I was sent to a Cambridge Kindergarten by my
            lovely parents, and I of course have my fair share of muslim &
            non-muslim accompanies there. Then, elementary freshman year hit.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the sudden, everything went upside down 180 degrees. Who was
            I? Was is my purpose being here? Childhood Omar was once a straight,
            reserved, and naive kid. Fair share of friends? Let's just say It
            was a toss-up. But one things for sure, the current Omar is night
            and day. We'll get to that later... I was such an Introvert, and
            still am today. But the one thing that stucked to me back then,
            changed the best of me. Something that I have cherished for so long
            that I must share will you. My Ambitiousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to become "Ambitious". Joining competitions, participating
            in organizations, even running for president. The results? It's a
            flip of the switch. Now, current senior year Omar will keep on
            learning and evolving. Destined to become an AI Professional in the
            future, and what better way to start my journey than to write &
            create this one of a kind website with love and conscience.
